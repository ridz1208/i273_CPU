i. INPUT
The input is in the upper right corner of the CPU, it is composed of 10 input pins which remain activated throughout the run. Simply choose one to enable.

ii. OPERAND
The operand for multiplication can be found in the ROM section. It it the rightmost value (constant) labeled “operand”. Must be set to desired value

iii.	ROM
The ROM consists of a mega-BUS connected directly to the RAM (16 x 8bits). It is set using hexadecimal values for each ram slot. Once all the values are set (operand), turn ON the enabler pin (right below the ROM), tick the clock once, and then turn the enabler OFF. This will copy all the different constants into the RAM registers to input the program. After that, let the CPU run normally to execute.
